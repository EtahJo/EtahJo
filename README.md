**`Full-stack Software Developer`**

I am a self-taught full-stack developer with several years of experience. I enjoy the process of thinking of technical solutions to real-life problems. The realisation of these solutions usually includes, breaking it down to small actionable steps and after deep reasearch, implemeting each step with the most suitable technologies available.
